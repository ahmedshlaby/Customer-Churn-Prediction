# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction Dashboard

An interactive **Machine Learning web app** built with **Streamlit** to analyze customer behavior, understand churn factors, and predict customer retention using a trained **XGBoost model**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn prediction is one of the most important use cases in customer analytics.  
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end Data Science workflow** — from data preprocessing and model training to deployment using Streamlit Cloud.

The app allows users to:
- Explore customer demographics and behavioral data  
- Understand key churn factors through visual analysis  
- Predict whether a customer will **stay or leave** using a trained ML model
